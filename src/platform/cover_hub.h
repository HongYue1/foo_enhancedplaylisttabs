// The now-playing cover's accent colour, shared by every container whose accent source is
// "cover". Main thread only.
//
// Costs nothing until the first subscriber: only then does it register with fb2k's now-playing
// art loader (which reads and caches the file once for all components) and a play callback.
// A cover is decoded (WIC, at most 256 px) and reduced to one colour on a worker, once per
// cover; recent covers are remembered by content hash, so skipping back costs nothing.
// After the last subscriber leaves, everything is unregistered again.
